          <br><p class="text">“The Statue of Peace has been a part of Berlin for the past four years. To suddenly remove it is to remove a piece of history, which is an act of violence.”</p><p class="text">These are the words of Yang Ching-ja, the co-chair of the Japan Nationwide Action for the Resolution of the Japanese Military “Comfort Women” Issue. The Hankyoreh met with Yang on Sunday in front of the German Embassy in Tokyo’s Minato ward. Yang and her fellow activists were protesting the removal of the Statue of Peace in Berlin’s Mitte borough. The local government in Berlin has demanded the statue be removed from the public grounds where it currently stands and be relocated to private property, threatening to forcibly remove the statue.&nbsp;</p><p class="text">After meeting with an official from the embassy, the activists submitted a written statement.&nbsp;</p><p class="text">“As citizens of Japan, we oppose the measure to remove the Statue of Peace from Berlin’s Mitte borough,” the statement said.&nbsp;</p><p class="text">“We ask that you remember the deep significance of the Statue of Peace and think of the desperation felt by the survivors,” the statement continued, referring to the women who were enslaved by the Japanese military in what it called the “comfort women” system.&nbsp;</p><p class="text">“It’s been over half a century since the Japanese military mobilized women during World War II to serve as sex slaves. The survivors of this system are telling the world that wartime sexual violence is completely unacceptable, a war crime that inflicts permanent wounds on the victims,” the statement continued. &nbsp;</p><p class="text">“The Statue of Peace is about more than memorializing the victims of the Japanese military. Even now, at this very moment, women in conflict zones all around the world are subjected to sexual violence. The Statue of Peace contains universal and modern significance,” the statement went on.</p><p class="text">The statement was co-signed by 562 people and 38 activist groups.&nbsp;</p><p class="text">Berlin’s Mitte borough has demanded the statue’s transfer to private property, arguing that as a private work of art and memorial, the Statue of Peace is permitted to stand on public grounds on a temporary basis.&nbsp;</p><p class="text">The local government has threatened to forcibly remove the statue if it is not moved to private property. Korea Verband, a local civic group that organized to bring the statue to Berlin, is vehemently protesting measures to have the statue removed. On Sept. 20, the Mitte borough assembly passed a resolution to permit the statue to remain where it is. However, the resolution is not legally binding. Activists in Japan are also protesting the statue’s removal from public grounds. &nbsp;</p><p class="text">“Unlike the introspective efforts of Germany, a country that once waged war by invading its neighbors, the Japanese government is trying to erase the past to cover up its wrongdoings,” the statement from Yang’s activist group said.&nbsp;</p><p class="text">“The statue is a symbol of peace, and they’re painting it as an instigator of conflict between South Korea and Japan. If there is friction between the two countries, it’s because the Japanese government is not acknowledging the injustice of the past and repeatedly engages in speech and behavior that degrades the victims,” the statement from the Japanese group read.&nbsp;</p><p class="text">After meeting with an official from the German Embassy in Tokyo, Yang told the Hankyoreh, “The German Embassy in Japan has not issued a statement on the issue. They have said that they will deliver our statement to local governments in Berlin and in the Mitte borough.”</p><p class="text">The activist collective is expected to send requests to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and to Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya to resolve the Statue of Peace issue.&nbsp;</p><p class="text">By Hong Seock-jae, Tokyo correspondent</p><p class="text">Please direct questions or comments to [<a href="mailto:english@hani.co.kr">english@hani.co.kr</a>]</p></div><a id="inner_originArticle" href="https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/international/international_general/1161420.html" target="_blank"><img src="./Removal of Berlin Statue of Peace would be ‘act of violence,’ Japanese civic group says_files/btn_original.gif" alt="button that move to original korean article (클릭시 원문으로 이동하는 버튼)"></a></div><div id="rt" class="related-article"><h3 class="article-tit">Related stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/1160432.html" class="ellipsis1">·&nbsp;<!-- -->Japanese Embassy bought meal at 5-star hotel to request block on funding for Berlin ‘comfort women’ project</a></li><li><a href="https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/1158874.html" class="ellipsis1">·&nbsp;<!-- -->Amid fight to keep Statue of Peace in Berlin, murky plans to replace it appear underway</a></li><li><a href="https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/1157724.html" class="ellipsis1">·&nbsp;<!-- -->German officials to explore ways to keep Berlin Statue of Peace in place, Korean delegation says</a></li><li><a href="https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/1150179.html" class="ellipsis1">·&nbsp;<!-- -->Berlin borough orders removal of ‘comfort women’ statue following pressure from Japan</a></li><li><a href="https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/1152323.html" class="ellipsis1">·&nbsp;<!-- -->Pressure from Japan likely behind Berlin’s funding cut for ‘comfort women’ education program</a></li></ul></div><div></div><div></div></div><div class="comm-fixed fixed-right"><div class="ad_300_250 right-con" style="margin-bottom:0px"><div class="BaseAd_adWrapper__kTNSx BaseAd_showText__ams9u"><div class="BaseAd_adInner__AFsOK" style="width:300px;height:250px"><span class="sr-only">광고</span><script type="text/javascript" src="./Removal of Berlin Statue of Peace would be ‘act of violence,’ Japanese civic group says_files/@x04" defer="true"></script><script type="text/javascript">

Yang and her fellow activists were protesting the removal of the Statue of Peace in Berlin’s Mitte borough.
